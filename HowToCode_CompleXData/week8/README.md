a: Two One-of Types
------------------

In this module, we will learn to design functions consuming two arguments which are one-of types. In order to do this, we will develop a new model of our code, the cross product of the types comment table.

The cross product of the types comment table first provides us with a way to clearly think of all possible test cases. We will then find it helps us get a basis for what our function's body will look like -- and even allow us to simplify it -- all before we even start coding. In this sense, it plays a role similar to the role of type comments and templates -- and in fact extends our idea of templating from simply what we copy from the types comments to what it really is; a method of knowing a great deal about what code will look like before we start coding details.

### Learning Goals

- Be able to produce the cross-product of type templates table for a function operating on two values with one-of types.
- Be able to use the table to generate examples and a template.
- Be able to use the table to simplify the function when there are equal answers in some cells.
