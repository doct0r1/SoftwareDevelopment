# Extracting Object-Oriented Design

**_Overview_**

Design is a critical step of constructing a software system. Good designs solve the problem at hand and exhibit desirable characteristics, such as being evolvable.

In this module we'll talk about extracting design from systems. This will involve using some diagrams that you're familiar with, and some that are completely new, to capture the design of systems - both their architecture, and their behaviour. In the next module we'll do the reverse, and learn how to implement a system based on these types of diagrams.

#### Things You'll Learn

- How  to extract the design of an existing system and record it using a UML class diagram.
- The different ways classes can rely on each other including associations, aggregations and dependencies.
- How to extract UML sequence diagrams from existing code.
