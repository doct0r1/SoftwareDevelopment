# Design Principles

**_Overview_**

At this point we've covered the foundations of designing Object-Oriented software. Now it's time to step back and take a look at design, and how to assess what makes a design good and what makes a design bad. We want to design software that's readable, maintainable and easily changed -- how do we achieve these properties?

In this module we'll look at a few different design principles that help us achieve the qualities we want in our code. We'll look at some common design problems and discuss how to solve them, and we'll talk about how to distinguish good design from bad design.

#### Things You'll Learn

- How to use the single-responsibility principle to reduce coupling and increase cohesion in your code
- How to use the Liskov substitution principle to ensure your class hierarchies are creating good design
- How to refactor code to fix design problems and adhere to these design principles
