# Design Patterns

**_Overview_**

Many of the problems you'll encounter when trying to achieve good design in your systems are problems that others have encountered before. Some of these problems have well-known elegant solutions which we call Design Patterns. A Design Pattern describes the specific way certain classes in your system can be structured to both solve your design problem, and maintain good design. 

We'll look at a few design patterns in this course, and there are others that you'll see in the next courses of the MicroMasters.

#### Things You'll Learn

- How Design Patterns can help you achieve good design
- How to implement the Composite Pattern to design programs on mutually recursive data
- How to implement the Observer Pattern to design programs that involve notifications, or one class monitoring another
- How to implement the Iterator Pattern to iterate over classes that are not a Java Collection.
