# 1: Introduction to Software Construction

In this module you will be introduced to some large programs -- bigger than what you've seen in prior courses in the Software Development MicroMasters. In addition to that, the code you see will be written in Java, a language you're likely not familiar with. 

This may seem backwards to you - to be immersed in a Java system before knowing any Java syntax at all. But learning how to make sense of an unfamiliar codebase in an unfamiliar language is an incredibly valuable skill. Software development is not a solitary activity, and developers in industry do not write their own systems from scratch. Rather, they work in large teams on huge codebases, often in language they weren't previously familiar with. This means that a large portion of a software developer's work consists of walking up to a codebase and understanding the structure and behaviour of the code, before they can build on it or integrate it into their own systems.

An expansive codebase may be unfamiliar and even intimidating at first. However, this unit will introduce strategies you can use to demystify a project's structure, identify the relationships between packages and classes, and equip you will the skills you'll use to make sense of any codebase, no matter the size.

### Things you'll learn (without knowing any Java!):

- How to explore the behaviour and structure of a system
- How to draw a diagram of the relationships between packages and between classes to help your understanding of a totally new system
- Make small changes to a system that you know nothing about, to see if it breaks or changes (this is the beginning of code exploration)
