# DATA ABSTRACTION

## In This Module

Data Abstraction is split into two modules - Data Abstraction: Specifying and Using and Data Abstraction: Testing and Implementing.

### Overview

Object-oriented software uses data abstraction to model the domain that the software addresses. Abstraction is a common and central concept in computer science. It enables the commonality between similar but different things to be represented while details that vary between the things are factored out. In this way, we can use a single abstraction to reason about many things (i.e., a one-to-many mapping).

There are three different kinds of abstraction used in the Java programming language: procedural abstraction, data abstraction, and iteration abstraction. In this module, we will focus on what a data abstraction is and how it is used in Java. As our means of describing data abstraction, we will rely on the use of procedural abstraction. We will look at iteration abstraction later in the course.

Data abstraction is one of the fundamental ideas that the entire course builds on, and because of that, this is one of the longest modules in the course.

### Things you'll learn:

- How to describe how data abstraction makes possible the construction of larger software systems
- How to specify a data abstraction for a Java class such that you can then move forward to creating tests for it
- How to consider use cases for a data abstraction to ensure that it is complete and meets your needs
- How to specify tests for a data abstraction such that you can be reasonably confident that your data abstraction's implementation meets its specification
- How to implement a data abstraction by deciding on an internal data representation and implementing the bodies of the specified methods.
