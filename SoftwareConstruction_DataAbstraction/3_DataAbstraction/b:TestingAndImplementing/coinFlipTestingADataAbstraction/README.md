# Let's test the Coin abstraction!

Now let's test the Coin abstraction!

Think about the fact that you want to get back Heads or Tails for each time you flip the coin. Testing randomness is going to be tough, but you could at least check something like "am I always getting back the same value?", or "am I getting back the same value a suspicious number of times in a row?". There are lots of ways to check that -- we've given two possibilities below. Don't look until you've tried some options of your own!
