# 2a: Control and Data Flow: Structures

### Overview

Control and data models help a software developer comprehend existing source code and can be used to help design new code. Software developers seldom write systems from scratch. Most often, software systems are long-lived and a software developer joining a team will be contributing to an existing system. Even when the construction of a new system begins, the system will typically be built using libraries of existing software components. As a result, software developers spend as much as half their time or more reading and understanding existing source code.

Software developers use many different techniques to help understand a part of a large source code base. In this module, we will consider how developers use control-flow and data models to begin to understand source code. The models presented in this section of the course are intended to get you reading existing (simple) Java code. We will build and expand on these basic concepts in the remainder of the course.

### Things you'll learn:

- **Java concepts**: classes, methods, how data flows in programs, how parameters are passed, how values are returned from methods, and how objects are created.
- **Control-flow models**: how to depict and communicate the internal execution of a method using flowcharts and how to depict and communicate the execution of a program using call graphs.  We will show you how to use a debugger to help produce these control-flow models from given Java source code
